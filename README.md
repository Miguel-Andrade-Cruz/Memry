# Welcome to Memry!

## Context

It al started with a simple question to my sister: "Tell me something to do", and now we are here.
I not gonna lie, i took about a month to do it working three times a week,
but the challenges made me understand better how p5js works and also
incorporate the crucial programmer brain: Always plan what you want to do,
´´íf not´´´, you will ceratinly forget what you're doing. Here are some of the
topics that i learned in this process:

## What I learned?

- (my theory) p5js works with metaprogramming,
so everything that uses p5js library, such like constants and functions,
needs to be executed inside the functions ´´´draw()´´´ or ´´´setup()´´´,
otherwise it will not be recognized.

- When you can't figure out how to do something on your project,
break it down on smaller steps. it helps you
